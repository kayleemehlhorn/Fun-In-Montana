# Fun-In-Montana
Multipage Website D277 Project for School

#Includes HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT
I wrote this webpage using raw code meaning no Bootstrap, React, Sass etc...
hence why it looks like it was made in the 90s (kind of retro though right?) 

#GitHub Pages
Using GitHub Pages allows me to "host" my website in a much easier way for me and the evaluator to interact with.
