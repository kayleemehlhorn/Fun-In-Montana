        <h1><em><strong>Small Village, Big Adventure</strong></em></h1>
        <p>Located in the Flathead Valley, nesetled within Montana's Rocky Mountains, Bigfork's 2020 census population
            was 5,118. In 2021 the median household income was $75,125, which is less than Whitefish but more than
            Helena. Living in Bigfork offers residents a suburban/rural mix feel. It is a great place for retirees!</p>
        <p>Bigfork may be small, but there are quite a few things to enjoy here. During Memorial Day weekend, Bigfork's
            whitewater festival is going on. A must see event if you are in town during that time. There is also a
            theatre in town that puts on plays all summer long, which they call "Broadway in the Rockies." Bigfork also
            has quite the food scene, with amazing sushi, breweries, and best of all their breakfast joints. </p>
        <p>Outside of town you will find lots of outdoor activities to keep you moving all year long. Flathead lake is a
            <strong>big</strong> lake that offers prime boating and fishing. Mt. Aneas is a summit hike 6 miles
            roundtrip that offers great views down into the valley, and you will most likely encounter some mountain
            goats along the way. And Blacktail ski resort offers lift access skiing/snowboarding to get your wintertime
            adreniline on. If you aren't into going downhill, there is also a plethora of nordic ski tracks to enjoy
            (especially with a furry friend).
